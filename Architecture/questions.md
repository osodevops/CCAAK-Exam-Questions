30. In a multi-data-center Kafka setup, what does replication across data centers primarily aim to achieve?
- [ ] High throughput
- [ ] Data retention
- [ ] Disaster recovery
- [ ] Leader election

**Answer:** Disaster recovery

**Explanation:** Replication across data centers primarily aims to achieve disaster recovery. In the event of a data center failure, the data in the other data center can be used to recover the system.

31. Which features of Kafka contribute to scalability in the architecture? (Select two)
- [ ] Using SSL/TLS for encryption
- [ ] Partitioning topics
- [ ] Creating consumer groups
- [ ] Data replication across data centers

**Answer:** Partitioning topics, Creating consumer groups

**Explanation:** Partitioning topics and creating consumer groups are two features of Kafka that contribute to scalability in the architecture. Partitioning topics allows for the distribution of data across multiple brokers, while creating consumer groups allows for parallel processing of data by multiple consumers. 

32. In a Kafka cluster, when the broker running the controller thread fails, which broker will become the new controller?
- [ ] The next broker in the cluster joined order
- [ ] The next broker to persist new metadata in Zookeeper
- [ ] The next broker to successfully recreate the Zookeeper ephemeral node
- [ ] The broker having the next highest broker.id value

**Answer:** The next broker to successfully recreate the Zookeeper ephemeral node 

**Explanation:** In a Kafka cluster, when the broker running the controller thread fails, the next broker to successfully recreate the Zookeeper ephemeral node will become the new controller. The controller is responsible for managing the state of partitions and replicas in the cluster.

33. What is a key benefit of Kafka's distributed log architecture?
- [ ] Faster network speed between producers and consumers
- [ ] Data encryption for secure transmission
- [ ] Ability to use different file systems for each broker
- [ ] Scalability through partitioning of topics across brokers

**Answer:** Scalability through partitioning of topics across brokers

**Explanation:** A key benefit of Kafka's distributed log architecture is scalability through partitioning of topics across brokers. This allows for parallel processing of data and high throughput.

34. Which component of Kafka manages the exact log segment in which a message resides?
- [ ] Zookeeper
- [ ] Producer
- [ ] Log Compaction
- [ ] Partition

**Answer:** Partition

**Explanation:** Partitions in Kafka manage the exact log segment in which a message resides. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages.

35. Which actions can improve the reliability of a Kafka production cluster? (Select two)
- [ ] Disabling log compaction
- [ ] Enabling automatic leader election
- [ ] Increasing replication factor
- [ ] Running multiple Zookeeper nodes

**Answer:** Increasing replication factor, Running multiple Zookeeper nodes

**Explanation:** Increasing the replication factor and running multiple Zookeeper nodes can improve the reliability of a Kafka production cluster. Increasing the replication factor provides redundancy and fault tolerance, while running multiple Zookeeper nodes helps distribute the load and provide high availability.

36. Which of the following are key components of Kafka's architecture? (Select two)
- [ ] Producers
- [ ] Consumers
- [ ] File Servers
- [ ] Data Hubs

**Answer:** Producers, Consumers

**Explanation:** Producers and consumers are key components of Kafka's architecture. Producers publish messages to topics, while consumers subscribe to topics and process messages.

37. A message written to a Kafka topic results in the creation of a new online shopping order. What is the best method to update the order when a new message is received by Kafka containing a status update?
- [ ] Write a Kafka Streams application that can update/modify the order message
- [ ] Use a Kafka connector to update the original order message
- [ ] Write a Kafka producer that will locate and update the order message
- [ ] Write a Kafka producer that will create a new message based upon the updated order status

**Answer:** Write a Kafka producer that will create a new message based upon the updated order status

**Explanation:** The best method to update the order when a new message is received by Kafka containing a status update is to write a Kafka producer that will create a new message based upon the updated order status. This approach ensures that the original order message remains unchanged and a new message is created to reflect the updated status.

38. Which characteristics of Kafka's commit log help provide durability and availability? (Select two)
- [ ] Partition replication across brokers
- [ ] Message ordering within partitions
- [ ] Partition sharding to external databases
- [ ] Message compression

**Answer:** Partition replication across brokers, Message ordering within partitions

**Explanation:** Partition replication across brokers and message ordering within partitions help provide durability and availability in Kafka. Replication ensures redundancy and fault tolerance, while message ordering ensures consistency and reliability.

39. Which of the following is a critical aspect of Kafka's reference architecture for multi-data-center deployments?
- [ ] Kafka Streams
- [ ] Fault tolerance
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] In-memory storage

**Answer:** Fault tolerance

**Explanation:** Fault tolerance is a critical aspect of Kafka's reference architecture for multi-data-center deployments. It ensures that the system can continue to operate in the event of failures or disruptions.

40. Kafka Streams applications can add extra load to the Kafka cluster even though stream processing doesn't take place on the Kafka cluster itself. Which of the following increases the load on the brokers based on stream processing? (Choose Two)
- [ ] Internal topics
- [ ] Number of connectors
- [ ] Changelog topics for local state stores
- [ ] Zookeeper ephemeral nodes

**Answer:** Internal topics, Changelog topics for local state stores

**Explanation:** Internal topics and changelog topics for local state stores can increase the load on the brokers based on stream processing. Internal topics are used for communication between stream processing tasks, while changelog topics store the state of local state stores.
