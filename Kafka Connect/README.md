# Introduction to Kafka Connect

Kafka Connect is a framework and toolset for building and running data pipelines between Apache Kafka and other data systems. It provides a scalable and reliable way to move data in and out of Kafka without writing custom integration code. First introduced in Kafka 0.10.0.0 in 2016, Kafka Connect has become a battle-tested component that remains resilient under heavy loads and at large scale.

## Core Concepts and Terminology

### Connectors
Connectors are the high-level abstractions that manage the data flow between Kafka and external systems. They come in two types:

- **Source Connectors**: Import data from external systems into Kafka topics
- **Sink Connectors**: Export data from Kafka topics to external systems

Connectors are responsible for breaking down the data movement job into a set of tasks that can be distributed across a cluster.

### Tasks
Tasks are the main actors in Kafka Connect's data model. Each connector coordinates a set of tasks that actually copy the data. Tasks have no internal state - their state is stored in special Kafka topics and managed by the connector. This stateless design allows tasks to be:

- Started, stopped, or restarted at any time
- Distributed across multiple workers for parallelism  
- Rebalanced when workers join or leave the cluster

### Workers
Workers are the runtime processes that execute connectors and tasks. Kafka Connect can run in two modes:

- **Standalone mode**: Runs on a single worker, useful for development and testing
- **Distributed mode**: Runs across multiple workers, providing scalability and fault tolerance

### Converters
Converters handle the serialization and deserialization of data between Kafka Connect's internal data format and the byte format stored in Kafka. Key converters include:

- **JsonConverter**: Serializes data as JSON
- **AvroConverter**: Uses Avro format with Schema Registry
- **StringConverter**: Simple string serialization

Converters can be specified at both the worker level (as defaults) and at the connector level (to override defaults).

## Key Configuration Parameters

### Worker Configuration
- **group.id**: A unique string identifying the Connect cluster group
- **key.converter/value.converter**: Specifies the converter class for keys and values
- **config.storage.topic**: Kafka topic where connector configurations are stored
- **offset.storage.topic**: Kafka topic where source connector offsets are stored
- **status.storage.topic**: Kafka topic where connector and task status are stored

### Storage Topic Configuration
- **config.storage.replication.factor**: Replication factor for the configuration storage topic (recommended: at least 3 for production)
- **offset.storage.replication.factor**: Replication factor for the offset storage topic
- **status.storage.replication.factor**: Replication factor for the status storage topic
- **offset.storage.partitions**: Number of partitions for the offset storage topic
- **status.storage.partitions**: Number of partitions for the status storage topic

### Connector Configuration
- **connector.class**: The Java class for the connector implementation
- **tasks.max**: Maximum number of tasks the connector can create for parallelism
- **topic.prefix**: Prefix added to topics created by the connector
- **transforms**: Data manipulation logic to apply to records

## How Kafka Connect Works

When a connector is submitted to a Kafka Connect cluster, the following process occurs:

1. The workers rebalance the full set of connectors and their tasks across the cluster
2. Each connector breaks down its job into tasks
3. Tasks are distributed across workers to balance the workload
4. When workers join or leave, tasks are automatically rebalanced
5. Data flows through the system with converters handling serialization/deserialization

Kafka Connect uses Kafka itself to store metadata about its operations, including connector configurations, offsets, and status updates. This design provides durability and allows the system to recover from failures.

By providing a standardized way to move data in and out of Kafka, Kafka Connect eliminates the need to write custom integration code and allows engineers to focus on their use cases rather than data movement logistics.
